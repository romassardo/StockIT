# 🔒 Mandatory UI Design Rule for the Code Agent

## 🧠 Global UI Directive

**Every user interface (UI) component, layout, or screen generated by this code agent must strictly follow the design and interaction specifications outlined in:**

`E:\Proyectos\StockIT\design-UX-UI-guide.md`

---

### 📌 Mandatory Scope:
- **Full-page layouts**
- **Individual components (inputs, buttons, tables, cards, etc.)**
- **Modals, forms, sidebar, header, dashboards**
- **Typography, spacing, color palette, iconography, and micro-interactions**

---

### ✅ Agent Expectations:
1. Before generating any component or layout, the agent must **read and apply the rules described in `design-UX-UI-guide.md`.**
2. **No custom styles or visual systems may be invented.** Use only the visual language defined in the document.
3. All colors, typefaces, borders, shadows, sizes, and spacing must **match exactly the values and patterns listed** in the guide.
4. When in doubt, **replicate the structural patterns** already described in the file.

---

### 🧪 Validation:
- Any design that does not conform to the rules in `design-UX-UI-guide.md` should be considered invalid and must be rejected.
- **Every UI artifact must align visually and structurally with sections 1 through 3** of the file.

### 🛑 This is a strict enforcement rule. Failure to comply is considered a breach of project standards.
