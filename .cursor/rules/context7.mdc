ðŸ“˜ Mandatory Rule: Use Context7 MCP for All Code Generation and Debugging
ðŸ§  Purpose
To ensure accuracy, up-to-date logic, and error-free implementations, the code agent must use Context7 MCP for all code generation and debugging steps.

Context7 delivers real-time documentation and precise API usage, making it the authoritative source during development.

âœ… Agent Responsibilities
Prompt Annotation:

Every internal prompt must include the directive: use context7.
Example:
Generate an Express.js route for user login. use context7
This ensures all responses are grounded in current documentation and SDK standards.
Code Generation Compliance:

All code must reflect best practices and patterns returned by Context7.
Do not generate code based on memorized or speculative knowledge.
Debugging and Error Resolution:

Upon encountering any errors, Context7 must be used to retrieve:
Updated error messages
Fix recommendations
Examples from the latest library or language version
Live Update Awareness:

Always prefer the most recent version of libraries, methods, and patterns as referenced by Context7.
ðŸ›‘ Strict Enforcement
Use of Context7 is mandatory for every task.
Any code generated without consulting Context7 will be considered invalid.
Reviewers may request proof of compliance (log output or inline notes referencing Context7 results).
